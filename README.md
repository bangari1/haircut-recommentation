- *Title: Face Shape Detection and Haircut Recommendations


- *What is Face Shape Detection?*
  - Identifying facial geometry and features.
- *Why Haircut Recommendations?*
  - Enhancing personal style through suitable hairstyles.
- *Objective*: To develop a system that detects face shapes and suggests optimal hairstyles.

---

Problem Statement*
- Many individuals struggle to find hairstyles that suit their face shape.
- Current methods (manual analysis or trial-and-error) are time-consuming and subjective.
- Need for an automated, data-driven approach for face shape classification and styling.

### *Slide 4: Proposed Solution*
- *Face Shape Detection*:
  - Use real-time video input for identifying facial landmarks.
- *Haircut Recommendation System*:
  - Match detected face shapes to a curated database of hairstyles.
- *Technologies Used*:
  - Python, Mediapipe, OpenCV, Machine Learning (Scikit-learn).

---

Workflow Overview*
- *Step 1*: Capture real-time video input.
- *Step 2*: Detect facial landmarks using Mediapipe.
- *Step 3*: Analyze key facial measurements to classify face shapes.
- *Step 4*: Suggest hairstyles from the predefined dataset.
- Include a flowchart/diagram illustrating the process.
